## Early Origins

The concept of night trains can be traced back to the mid-19th century when railways started connecting major cities in Europe. The first overnight services were introduced in the late 1800s, with luxurious sleeper cars reserved for the wealthy. Initially, these trains were primarily focused on transporting mail and goods, but it soon became apparent that there was a demand for passenger services as well.

The early 20th century marked the golden age of night trains in Europe. These trains expanded their routes, connecting more countries and cities across the continent. The Orient Express, launched in 1883, is one of the most famous examples, offering a luxurious and romantic mode of travel between Paris and Istanbul. This iconic train became a symbol of sophistication and adventure, immortalized in literature and movies.

During this time, many overnight services were introduced, catering to a wide range of budgets and preferences. From basic couchette cars with minimal facilities to grand sleeping cars complete with private compartments and dining cars, night trains offered an experience that went beyond mere transportation.

## Decline and Resurgence

In the second half of the 20th century, night trains faced challenges from other modes of transportation, including the rise of budget airlines and increased competition from high-speed trains. With advancements in technology and changing travel preferences, many night train services were gradually discontinued or reduced.

However, in recent years, night trains have experienced a resurgence, driven by growing awareness of environmental concerns and the desire for sustainable travel options. Railway companies and governments across Europe have recognized the potential of night trains in offering an environmentally friendly mode of transport for long-distance journeys.
